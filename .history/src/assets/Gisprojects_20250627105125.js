It shows agriculture as the dominant land use, with built-up areas growing in the north and south, forest cover in the south, and minimal but important water bodies. The analysis was done using ArcGIS and visualized with charts in Excel. It can support planners, environmentalists, researchers, and policy makers working toward sustainable land management and development.",
