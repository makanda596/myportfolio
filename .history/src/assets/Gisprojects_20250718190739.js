It shows agriculture as the dominant land use, with built-up areas growing in the north and south, forest cover in the south, and minimal but important water bodies. The analysis was done using ArcGIS and visualized with charts in Excel. It can support planners, environmentalists, researchers, and policy makers working toward sustainable land management and development.",

High turbidity (in red) is concentrated in the northern parts of the county, especially along the lake edge, likely due to sediment runoff, human activity, and surface erosion. Low turbidity areas (in green) dominate the deeper lake zones and southern regions. The analysis was performed using ArcMap, with visualizations done in Google Earth Pro.People who can benefit from this map:- Environmental agencies monitoring water quality,- County planners addressing pollution sources,- Fisheries and aquaculture stakeholders,- NGOs working on conservati- Researchers in water resource management and climate change",
